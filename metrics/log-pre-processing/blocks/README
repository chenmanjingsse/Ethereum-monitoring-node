(1) go to the folder with all the blocks.log.xx files

(2) copy there ../concatLogs.sh, and all scripts from this folder

(3a) run:
$ sudo python3 blocks-dropDuplicates.py blocks.log
(Result) it will create one final unique-blocks.log.FINAL

(3b) run:
$ sudo python3 blocksAnnouncements-dropDuplicates.py blocksAnnouncements.log
(Result) it will create one final unique-blockAnnouncements.log.FINAL

(4) concatenate heads.log.*  into one
$ sudo bash concatLogs.sh heads.log (if there are more than one ofc.)
(optional) manually delete first couple of logs from heads.log -->  till it syncs

(5) sudo python3 MergeBlocks.py  
a) this sets the lowest timestamp of block reception (from both blocks.log and blocksAnnouncements.log)
b) goes through heads.log and marks BlockType in blocks.log which blocks are on MAIN blockchain and which are Uncles
produces blocksMergedCheckManuallyNow.log    that may contain BlockType==nan or "CheckManually"

(6) 
python 3 BlockTypes.py   -> to show if there is need to check the block manually 

(7) manually set the blocks with  BlockType==nan or "CheckManually"  to Main/Uncle

(8) sudo python3 MergeBlocks-2.py 
that sets Uncles into  Recognized or Unrecognized..
