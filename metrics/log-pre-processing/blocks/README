(1) go to the folder with all the blocks.log.xx files

(2) copy there ../concatLogs.sh, and all scripts from this folder

(3a)$ sudo bash dropDuplicates.sh blocks
(Result) it will create one final unique-unique-blocks.log.FINAL

(3b) $ sudo bash dropDuplicates.sh blocksAnnouncements
(Result) it will create one final unique-unique-blockAnnouncements.log.FINAL


(4) make sure that unique-unique-blocks.log.FINAL's blocks are consecutive and last block IS on the MAIN CHAIN and not some uncle
  verify that via metrics/log-pre-processing/blocks/aux dir  --> check  non-sense blocks...
   then manually remove them from this and put to a special csv..   (TODO -> a cript to do this..)

(5) sudo python3 MergeBlocks-0.py  
this sets the lowest timestamp of block reception (from both blocks.log and blocksAnnouncements.log)
output: unique-unique-blocks.log.FINAL.TimestampsUpdated

(6) sudo python3 MergeBlocks-1.py    # TODO   Done but properly check if it works properly
  goes through unique-unique-blocks.log.FINAL.TimestampsUpdated and sets the last block's blocktype as 'Main'
  then it goest to that block's parentHash and sets that block as 'Main', recursively till the first block
produces blocksMergedCheckManuallyNow.log   with 'Main' blocks and Nan ...

TODO !!!!  (7) script to se uncles ....  carefully !!
should be easy




(8b) $ sudo python3 BlockTypes.py blocksMergedCheckManuallyNow.log   -> to show if there is need to check the block manually 
(opt)(8c) manually set the blocks with  BlockType==nan or "CheckManually" to Main/Uncle
(8d) $ mv blocksMergedCheckManuallyNow.log blocksMergedChecked.log

(9) $sudo python3 MergeBlocks-2.py 
that sets Uncles into  Recognized or Unrecognized..
(9b) $sudo python3 BlockTypes.py blocksFinal.log  -> to see how many uncles/recognized..
